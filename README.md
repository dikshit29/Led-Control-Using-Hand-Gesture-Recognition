This project presents the design and implementation of a real-time hand gesture recognition 
and LED control system. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and hardware 
integration, the system aims to provide an intuitive and interactive method for controlling 
electronic devices using hand gestures. The core components of the system include the 
MediaPipe framework for hand detection, OpenCV for image processing, and an Arduino 
microcontroller for LED control.
