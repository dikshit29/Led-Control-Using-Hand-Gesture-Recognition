Abstract of the Project-
This project presents the design and implementation of a real-time hand gesture recognition 
and LED control system. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and hardware 
integration, the system aims to provide an intuitive and interactive method for controlling 
electronic devices using hand gestures. The core components of the system include the 
MediaPipe framework for hand detection, OpenCV for image processing, and an Arduino 
microcontroller for LED control.

Conclusion-
This project demonstrates the effective integration of computer vision and hardware control, 
showcasing the potential of hand gesture recognition systems. The developed system is not only a 
proof-of-concept but also a versatile platform for future development in human-computer interaction, 
smart home automation, and other interactive applications. The successful implementation and testing 
underscore the feasibility and practicality of such systems in real-world scenarios.
